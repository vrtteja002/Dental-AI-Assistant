# DentalChat AI Automation

ðŸ¦· **AI-powered chatbot that automates dental patient intake and creates posts on DentalChat platform**

## What It Does

This system replaces manual form filling with a natural conversation. Patients chat with an AI assistant that:
- Collects dental problem details through conversation
- Extracts patient information (name, contact, location, pain level)
- Automatically creates and submits posts to DentalChat
- Connects patients with local dentists

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing** - Conversational intake instead of forms
- **Smart Information Extraction** - AI extracts structured data from chat
- **Emergency Detection** - Identifies urgent cases based on symptoms/pain
- **Auto-Post Creation** - Direct integration with DentalChat API
- **Contact Validation** - Phone/email format checking

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables
Create `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
DENTALCHAT_API_KEY=your_dentalchat_api_key_here
```

### 3. Run Application
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

## How It Works

1. **Patient starts conversation** - "I have tooth pain"
2. **AI asks follow-up questions** - Pain level, location, contact info
3. **Information extracted automatically** - No manual form filling
4. **Post created and submitted** - Directly to DentalChat platform
5. **Local dentists notified** - Patient gets responses from nearby dentists
